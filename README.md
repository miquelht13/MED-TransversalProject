# MED - Transversal Project
Documentation summary and codes respository for our MED - Transversal Project

## 1. PHASE 1

### [1.1 Activity 1: The Basics of a drone](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7252710406031372288)
This section will cover the following topics: the design, size, load capacity, and uses of drones, which are common criteria for their classification. This project focuses on a quadcopter drone that can be operated either via remote control or autonomously.

### [1.2 Activity 2: Unboxing](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7252711009163825154)
This section covers the unboxing of key drone components: the Hexsoon drone frame, radio control, Autopilot for navigation, laser altimeter, battery checker, landing pad, Raspberry Pi for onboard processing, GPS compass, radio telemetry kit, Black box, and toolbox for assembly and maintenance.

### [1.3 Activity 3: Frame Assembly - Part 1](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7252711680806187009)
The assembly process is straightforward, with all necessary components included. 
Here you will find step by step the entire construction of the first part of the drone, which is made up of the most basic elements of the device to be able to fly:
 - Frame assembly
 - Motors and ESCs
 - PDB connection
 
Key points to consider are the motor orientation and the power distribution board, which is mounted on the top black plate.

### [1.4 Activity 4: Radio Control](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7252766227394142208)
In this activity we have calibrated the controller. The controller is one of the most important parts, as we sre going to control the drone with it. We have lesfnt how to configure the dfferent channels in order to send orders to the drone!

### [1.5 Activity 5: Autopilot](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7252767280122449920)
The autopilot is like the brain of the drone. It receives orders from the remote controller and executes them sending orders to the different actuators. We think is one of the most difficult parts in all the process, as you must be careful about how some parameters are configured!

### [1.6 Activity 6: Frame Assembly - Part 2](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7252767412045942784)
In this part of the project we have allocated the different antennas and receivers on the drone. In this part we had to pay attention to how wires and antennas were connected as they cannot disturb the rotators!

### [1.7 Activity 7: More Calibrations](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7252788385621180418)
This activity covers the set up of the platform, taking the following points:
- Telemetry radio calibration.
- ESCs calibration.
- FailSafe and Arm/Disarm configuration.
- Battery monitor configuration.
- Load default parameters for the chosen frame.
- Final configuration tests.

### [1.8 Activity 8: Flight Tests](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7252790637563928576)
Once everything was ready, it was time to put it to the test. During this activity, we described our experience testing and flying the drone inside the DroneLab facilities, located at the UPC-EETAC (Baix LLobregat Campus).

Also, we let you here the links for the two videos mentioned in this document:
- [First flight](https://lnkd.in/dxRzHKCi)
- [Second Flight](https://lnkd.in/dHzvhWr8)

### [1.9 Activity 9: Log Analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7252793126744952835)
Once the flights were completed, we obtained the data logs of the last completed flight (seen in the YT video from the previous publication) in order to analyse the information stored by the autopilot. 
The information we have focused on analysing is the altitude given by different sensors in the system, the pitch and roll values due to the ‘small problem’ at take-off, the battery voltage values, as well as additional information that we found useful and interesting.
